## Quick Overview

Have been working in technology for over 25 years in mixed roles from software development, to system and network admin to management.

Currently residing in Melbourne Australia. Father of 1.

I like finding good solutions to automate repetitive and time consuming problems.

## Preferred Working Style

Hybrid. Its nice not having to travel every day but a bit of face to face really makes a big difference to team dynamics.

## Management Style

I prefer individual autonomy over heavy oversight. Aim for clear communication and alignment, explain objectives and problems over steering architecture and design. 
I have found from past experience that too much input into design results in lacking ownership over the final product.
Setting well-defined goals ensures every engineer understands how their work contributes to the bigger picture.

I prefer my team to have opportunities for face-to-face collaboration, but respect the fact that some people find offices distracting to work in for focus-type work.

I always try and structure work calendars and meetings for the team to ensure individuals have as much focus time as possible. That generally means finding out where people are at there most effective and ensuring they have as much distraction free time there. Not everyone is the same. The biggest challenges often arise with different mindsets conflicting and distracting each other and this requires consistent review.

I like processes to help the team keep on top of things, possibly to a fault as they do help myself keep on top of everything. I do try and be conscious of the fact that I set a lot of these processes for the benefit of myself and be aware when I might be steering away from the "people over processes" mindset.

I am capable of coding and architecting complicated solutions, but these days I try keep the relationship as an "informed advisor" rather than "architect". I tend to spend my "maker time" working on tangental things such as building tools to help with operational challenges so I don't become a blocker to the team or become an "ivory tower architect".
